library-script

- v2.0 Stable. (although bug reports are welcome!)

A basic web app which helps you register books with their author and an unique number into a MySQL database, and then search for them. It also helps you to keep logs of people you have rented certain books. All coded in vanilla PHP.

I have added an automated installer script. You will need a MySQL database and its credentials for installation.

Just upload the files to your www public directory and browse the website. Then follow the instructions :-)
